<h2>Day 9: All in a Single Night</h2>
<p>Santa needs to visit multiple locations and wants to find the shortest distance to travel between them.</p>
<p>He has a list of distances between each pair of locations.</p>
<p>Santa can start and end at any two different locations, but he must visit each location exactly once.</p>
<p>The task is to determine the shortest distance Santa can travel to achieve this.</p>
<p>For example, given the following distances:</p>
<pre>
London to Dublin = 464
London to Belfast = 518
Dublin to Belfast = 141
</pre>
<p>The possible routes are:</p>
<pre>
Dublin -> London -> Belfast = 982
London -> Dublin -> Belfast = 605
London -> Belfast -> Dublin = 659
Dublin -> Belfast -> London = 659
Belfast -> Dublin -> London = 605
Belfast -> London -> Dublin = 982
</pre>
<p>The shortest of these routes is <code>London -> Dublin -> Belfast = 605</code>, so the answer is <code>605</code> in this example.</p>
<p>Find the distance of the shortest route.</p>
