<h2>Day 2: Inventory Management System</h2>
<p>You have a list of box IDs in a warehouse. You need to find the checksum, which is calculated by counting the number of box IDs that contain exactly two of any letter, and the number of box IDs that contain exactly three of any letter. Multiply these two counts together to get the checksum.</p>
<p>For example, given the following box IDs:</p>
<ul>
<li>abcdef</li>
<li>bababc</li>
<li>abbcde</li>
<li>abcccd</li>
<li>aabcdd</li>
<li>abcdee</li>
<li>ababab</li>
</ul>
<p>There are four box IDs that contain a letter which appears exactly twice, and three box IDs that contain a letter which appears exactly three times. The checksum is calculated as 4 * 3 = 12.</p>
<p>What is the checksum for your list of box IDs?</p>
