<h2>Day 12: Hill Climbing Algorithm</h2>
<p>You are given a heightmap of the surrounding area, represented as a grid with each square's elevation represented by a lowercase letter. Your task is to find the fewest steps required to move from your current position (<code>S</code>) to the location that should get the best signal (<code>E</code>). You can only move up, down, left, or right to a square with an elevation that is at most one higher than your current square.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
Sabqponm
abcryxxl
accszExk
acctuvwj
abdefghi
</pre>
<p>Starting from the top-left corner, you need to find the shortest path to the goal (<code>E</code>). The symbols <code>^</code>, <code>v</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, and <code>&gt;</code> indicate whether the path exits each square moving up, down, left, or right respectively. The <code>.</code> symbol marks unvisited squares.</p>
<p>Using the given heightmap, find the fewest steps required to reach the location that should get the best signal.</p>
