## **Understanding the Problem**

The corrupted password database at the North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop contains a list of password policies. Each password policy consists of the following:

- The lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear in the password.
- The password itself.

We need to determine the number of valid passwords based on the given policy.

In the example provided, the password policy "1-3 a" means that the password must contain the letter "a" at least 1 time and at most 3 times.

The middle password ("cdefg") in the example is not valid because it contains no instances of the letter "b", but it requires at least 1 instance. The first and third passwords are valid because they contain one "a" and nine "c", respectively.

## **Approach**

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Iterate over each password policy.
2. Split the password policy into the required frequency, the letter, and the password itself.
3. Get the counts of the given letter in the password.
4. Check if the count is within the required frequency range.
5. Count the number of valid passwords.
6. Return the count of valid passwords at the end.

## **Implementation in Python**

Here's an example implementation in Python:

```python
def count_valid_passwords(password_policies):
    count = 0

    for policy in password_policies:
        freq_range, letter, password = policy.split(" ")
        min_freq, max_freq = map(int, freq_range.split("-"))
        actual_freq = password.count(letter)

        if min_freq <= actual_freq <= max_freq:
            count += 1

    return count

# Example usage
password_policies = ["1-3 a: abcde", "1-3 b: cdefg", "2-9 c: ccccccccc"]
valid_passwords = count_valid_passwords(password_policies)
print(valid_passwords)  # Output: 2
```

**Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the number of password policies. We iterate once over each password policy to count the valid passwords.
