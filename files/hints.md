This problem involves finding the shortest path from the starting position to the destination position on a grid, taking into account the elevations of each square.

One possible approach to solve this problem is to use a variant of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to solve the problem:

1. Parse the input grid and store it in a data structure, such as a 2D array or a nested list. Each element of the grid represents the elevation at that position.

2. Implement the BFS algorithm. Start by initializing a queue and adding the starting position to it. You can represent each position as a tuple (row, column) or as a custom object that includes the position and other relevant information.

3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a position from the queue.

4. Check if the dequeued position is the destination position. If it is, return the number of steps taken to reach that position.

5. Explore the neighboring positions of the dequeued position. For each neighboring position, check if it is a valid move based on the elevation conditions mentioned in the problem description.

6. If a neighboring position is valid, enqueue it in the queue and keep track of the number of steps taken to reach that position.

7. Repeat steps 3-6 until either the destination position is found or the queue becomes empty.

8. If the queue becomes empty without finding the destination position, it means it is not reachable from the starting position. In this case, return an appropriate value, such as -1, to indicate that it is not possible to reach the destination.

9. Once you have implemented the BFS algorithm, run it on the provided example grid to verify that it returns the correct result of 31 steps.

10. Apply the BFS algorithm to the actual input grid to find the fewest steps required to move from the starting position to the destination position.

11. Return the result as the output of the program.

Remember to handle various edge cases, such as invalid input, unreachable destination position, and handling the elevation conditions correctly during the BFS traversal.
